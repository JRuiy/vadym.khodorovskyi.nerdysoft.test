##  :speech_balloon: Description
`This is my way of solving a test from NerdySoft. I divided all the logic into different classes and packages. 
I also covered all important methods with Unit tests.`

## :zap: Instruction
Just run the `main` method in the Main class. And to check if all the tests work, run the `mvn clean package` command.
